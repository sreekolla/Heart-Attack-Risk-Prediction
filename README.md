# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
#Overview

#This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. It involves data #cleaning, feature extraction, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

#Instructions for Replication
#Environment Setup
#Make sure you have Anaconda 3.9 or later installed on your system.

#Clone the Repository
#Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/sreekolla/Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction.git

#Install Dependencies
#Navigate to the project directory and create a new conda environment using the provided environment.yml file:


cd heart_attack_prediction_project
conda env create -f environment.yml

#This will install all the necessary dependencies required for the project.

#Data Preparation
#Ensure you have the dataset "heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv" in the project directory. If not, you can #obtain it from the original source or use your own dataset, but make sure to modify the file path accordingly in #the code.

#Run the Jupyter Notebook
#Launch Jupyter Notebook using the following command:


jupyter notebook

#Open the notebook heart_attack_prediction.ipynb and run each cell sequentially to replicate the entire project #workflow. Make sure to update any file paths if necessary.

#Results and Interpretation
#After running all the cells in the notebook, you'll be able to see the evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, #and ROC curves for each model. Feel free to analyze the results and make interpretations accordingly.

#Contact Information
#For any inquiries or assistance regarding the project, feel free to contact Sreerasya Kolla at kollas@uwm.edu
