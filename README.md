# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction


This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. It involves data cleaning, feature extraction, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

#Instructions for Replication
#Environment Setup
#Make sure you have Anaconda 3.9 or later installed on your system.

Open Git bash
create a project using  below command
mkdir <projectname>

move to project 
cd <projectname>
#make sure your are  in the respective directory

#Clone the Repository
#Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/sreekolla/Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction.git

#check for the files in the folder created above 

Open anaconda navigator and launch jupyter notebook

Open the notebook heart_attack_prediction.ipynb and run each cell sequentially to replicate the entire project workflow. Make sure to update any file paths if necessary.

Data Preparation
Ensure you have the dataset "heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv" in the project directory. If not, you can obtain it from the original source( url below) or use your own dataset, but make sure to modify the file path accordingly in the code.

Results and Interpretation
After running all the cells in the notebook, you'll be able to see the evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves for each model. Feel free to analyze the results and make interpretations accordingly.
